Description
Health care workers (HCWs) are at risk of experiencing accidental morbidity and mortality due to HIV and other blood borne pathogens (BBP) such as Hepatitis B Virus (HBV), Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) among others in the course of their duty. The need to cover HCWs against the high risk of HIV and other BBP emanating from accidental occupational exposures is thus urgent. Care for Carers (C4C) is a mobile based system developed to support (HCWs to enable HCWs register into the platform, report exposures and receive adherence messaging. The platform will provide a monitoring process that will follow the HCWs until they complete the post exposure prophylaxes and testing up to the sixth month unless they opt out of the platform.

Goal
To improve reporting of injuries as well as increase uptake of, and adherence to PEP therapy among HWs in Kenya.

Outcome Measures
Secure and confidential mode of PEP communication among HCW.
Ability for HCW and caregivers to register to the system and report injuries.
Provision of PEP knowledge and communication materials.
Sending automatic reminders to affected HCW.
Providing a data management and reporting platform on PEP surveillance.

What is CodeIgniter
###################

CodeIgniter is an Application Development Framework - a toolkit - for people
who build web sites using PHP. Its goal is to enable you to develop projects
much faster than you could if you were writing code from scratch, by providing
a rich set of libraries for commonly needed tasks, as well as a simple
interface and logical structure to access these libraries. CodeIgniter lets
you creatively focus on your project by minimizing the amount of code needed
for a given task.
